`restruct` is used to interpret binary data stored in files or other sources or convert
between C structs and Rust types and when using a parser-generator is considered
disproportionate.
It is a brainchild of [Python's struct-module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html).

See the `restruct_derive`-crate for documentation.
